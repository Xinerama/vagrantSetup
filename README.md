In this repo I will try to detail what I have done in my personal time to establish a virtual mutli-sandboxed environment whereby one may practice installing and running virtualmachines/containers with minimal effort.
I plan on relying on <a href=https://github.com/cbbrowne/tpp>tpp (Not the TransPacific Partnership)</a> but the Terminal Presentation Program. This in conjuction with <a href="https://asciinema.org/">ASCII Nema</a>. Just as soon as I figure out how to get it installed.

I have been writing online for sometime, but not a narative sense...in well, ever. This will be my first attempt in a long time to tell a story to go along with what we are about to learn.
If you would like to see my purely technical write-ups, blog posts, you can visit my site <a href="http://xinerama.blogspot.com/">Heart and Seoul</a> which has strictly barebones commands and such. 
Here I will take what is there and try to boil down the contents and illustrate it in a much more, may I dare say interactive even, representation of what you can do at home to replicate the <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/68583/what-is-the-correct-pronunciation-of-the-word-processes">processes</a>.

This should be an update
